# Knowledge Graph Explorer
This is a react application that demonstrates reading data from a GraphQL server and displaying in as a network graph.
Through this application I aim to use the following libraries and frameworks

For the backend
* Spring boot
* H2 in memory database
* GraphQL spring boot starter

For the frontend
* React
* Relay
* A network graph visualization library (yet to be decided)

The data is a simple data set of the Harry Potter world, which is loaded from https://data.world/harishkgarg/harry-potter-universe
